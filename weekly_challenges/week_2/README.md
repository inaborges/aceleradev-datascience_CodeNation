# Python Data Preprocessing

In this challenge we will practice data manipulation by using
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library. Data manipulation is one of the fundamental tasks in data science and pandas - one of the most popular Python library on the subject - helps to make this task enjoyable.

## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to extract some quantitative information that can help us to understand the nature of the data available and get some _insights_ on our _data set_.

Here, it will be evaluated the _data set_ [Black Friday](https://codenation-challenges.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-science-0/black_friday.csv), which was originally available by [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/) and is also availabe on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) platform. The _data set_ contains some features related to business transactions registered during Black Friday at a given retail store. Each observation is relative to a particular item purchased by an user, which may have purchased more than one item.

## Topics

Here, we will work with:

* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter notebook

## Requirements

Python 3 and pip. It is highly recommended to use virtual environments with `virtualenv` and the `requirements.txt` file to install the dependency packages for this challenge:

```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv -p python3
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows

```bash
> pip3 install virtualenv
> virtualenv ..\venv -p python3
> ..\venv\Scripts\activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you finish your task, you can deactivate your `venv` with:

```bash
$ deactivate
```
