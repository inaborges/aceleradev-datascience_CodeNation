# Probability functions

In this challenge we will practice exercices on hypothesis tests, one of the central concepts of statistical inference and of all research that uses statistics as a support.

## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to explore some hypothesis testing functions available in packages such as SciPy, learning to interpret their results, being critical about their uses and understanding what is behind these tests.

We will use the _data set_ [2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro](https://www.kaggle.com/rio2016/olympic-games/)
It contains 11 variables regarding 11538 athletes who participated in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

## Topics

* Probability
* Statistics
* Hypothesis testing
* A/B tests

## Requirements

Python 3 and pip. It is highly recommended to use virtual environments with `virtualenv` and the `requirements.txt` file to install the dependency packages for this challenge:

```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv -p python3
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows

```bash
> pip3 install virtualenv
> virtualenv ..\venv -p python3
> ..\venv\Scripts\activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt

When you finish your task, you can deactivate your `venv` with: 

```bash
$ deactivate
```
